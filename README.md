Taelin AI Scripts
=================

Some AI scripts I use daily.

- `chatsh`: like ChatGPT but in the terminal ([example chat](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1655304645953089538)) ([example coding](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1809290888356729002)) ([example refactor](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1828893898594300220))

- `holefill`: I use it on VIM to fill code snippets

For VIM integration, this is my messy [vimrc](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/OSX/blob/master/vimrc).

This repo in general is kinda gambiarra. Note: currently updating to ts!

## Usage

Just `npm install -g` and run the given command the terminal.

You'll need to add Anthropic/OpenAI/etc. keys to `~/.config`.

## Note

Most of this scripts will save a log to `~/.ai`. If you don't want this
behavior, edit the scripts to suit your needs. (TODO: add a proper option.)
