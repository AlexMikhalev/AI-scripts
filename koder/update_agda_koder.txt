# Guide to Update agda_koder.txt

## What is agda_koder.txt?
agda_koder.txt is a guide for an AI that assists with coding in Agda. It contains instructions, examples, and guidelines for the AI to follow when helping users with Agda programming tasks.

## Importance of Syncing Examples
The examples in agda_koder.txt must be kept in sync with the canonical Agda files. This ensures that the AI provides up-to-date and accurate assistance based on the current state of the Agda codebase.

## Location of Canonical Agda Files
The canonical Agda files are located in the ~/vic/dev/monobook directory and its subdirectories. These files represent the most current and correct implementations of Agda code for the project.

## Instructions for Updating agda_koder.txt

1. Review the current agda_koder.txt file to understand its structure and content.

2. Examine the Agda files in ~/vic/dev/monobook to identify any changes or new implementations.

3. Update the examples in agda_koder.txt to match the current state of the canonical Agda files. Focus on the following sections:
   - GUIDE FOR THE AGDA LANGUAGE
   - Idiomatic Agda Examples

4. Ensure that the updated examples follow the same style and format as the original guide.

5. Do not modify any other content in agda_koder.txt. Only update the examples to reflect the current state of the Agda files.

6. After updating the examples, review the entire agda_koder.txt to ensure consistency and accuracy.

7. Save the updated agda_koder.txt file.

## Specific Example of Updating

Let's take the List module as an example:

1. Locate the canonical Agda file:
   ~/vic/dev/monobook/Data/List/Type.agda

2. Open and review the content of this file.

3. Find the corresponding example in agda_koder.txt. It might look like this:

   ### Data/List/Type.agda

   ```agda
   module Data.List.Type where

   data List {a} (A : Set a) : Set a where
     []  : List A
     _,_ : (head : A) (tail : List A) â†’ List A
   {-# BUILTIN LIST List #-}

   infixr 5 _,_
   ```

4. Compare the content of the canonical file with the example in agda_koder.txt.

5. If there are any differences, update the example in agda_koder.txt to match the canonical file exactly.

6. Repeat this process for all examples in the guide, ensuring each one matches its corresponding canonical file in ~/vic/dev/monobook.

Remember: The goal is to keep the examples in sync with the canonical Agda files while preserving the overall structure and content of the guide.

# TASK

Let's now update agda_koder.txt in 3 steps.

- 1: read agda_koder.txt (i.e., perform 'cat agda_koder.txt').

- 2: read ALL relevant canonical Agda files (using 'cat' for each example used inside agda_koder.txt').

- 3. rewrite the ENTIRE agda_koder.txt in order to update the examples. don't change anything else.

Remember: use an 'sh' block to overwrite agda_koder.txt from the terminal, completing the task.

Let's do it now.
